This repository demonstrates a common issue with CSS's `calc()` function where unexpected results occur when combining percentages and fixed units like pixels.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` offers solutions for resolving the unexpected behavior. The problem arises when the calculated value depends on the parent's width, which might not always align precisely with the percentage calculation.
